## Hi, I'm Mathabo Motaung
I am an aspiring software developer with a passion for solving problems through code. I recently graduated and am looking for my first professional role where I can contribute and learn from a strong team.

While I have experience with a few different languages, I have a strong preference for the Java ecosystem. I enjoy the structure of object-oriented programming and am currently diving deeper into building clean, reliable backend services.

**Current Focus:** Right now, I am teaching myself how to write better unit tests with JUnit because I want my code to be reliable in production.

#### Tools & Workflow

 * **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

 * **Deployment & Cloud:** Docker, Basic AWS & Azure knowledge

 * **Practices:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), SDLC, CI/CD basics

## Projects:
Here are a few projects I built to practice my coding skills and learn new concepts.

* **[Velosales](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/Velosales.git)**
  * **Focus:** Algorithms & Data Processing
    
  *A Java utility I built to calculate "stock velocity", how fast specific products are selling over time. You send it a list of sales numbers, and it calculates how fast products are moving off the shelves. This helps figure out which items need to be restocked.*
  
  * **Tech:** Java, REST API
  
  * **What I learned:** Writing logic to process data batches efficiently.

* **[S3entinel](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/S3entinel)**
  * **Focus:** Backend Logic & File Handling
    
  *A Java API that allows users to upload files securely. As soon as a file is uploaded, the code automatically pulls out the important details (metadata) from it in the background.*
  
  * **Tech:** Java, AWS (Lambda/S3)
  
  * **What I learned:** How to handle asynchronous events and process files in the cloud.

* **[ToroTrack | Client Collaboration Tool](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/ToroTrack)**
  * **Focus:** Full Stack .NET
    
  *A web application for client collaboration. I built this to get comfortable with the Microsoft ecosystem, using Blazor for the frontend and containerizing the app for easier deployment.*
  
  * **Tech:** C#, .NET 8, Blazor, Docker
  
  * **What I learned:** Building a full-stack application and using containers.
  
* **[Mofani](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/Mofani)**
  * **Focus:** Security & User Roles
  
  *A system for managing donations and volunteers. The complexity here was in the database design and security, ensuring that different users (like admins vs. volunteers) had exactly the right access permissions.*
  
  * **Tech:** C#, Azure SQL
  
  * **What I learned:** Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and SQL relationships.

* **[Grit Ledger](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/Grit-Ledger)**
 * **Focus:** Data Integrity

 *A PHP API that simulates a banking transaction system. The main goal was to ensure that money transfers between accounts are safe and that funds never "disappear" if the system crashes midway through a request.*
 
* **Tech:** PHP, SQL
 
* **What I learned:** ACID compliance and preventing race conditions in databases.
