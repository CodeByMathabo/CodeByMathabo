## Hi, I'm Mathabo

* I am a software developer transitioning into **Cloud Architecture** and **DevOps Engineering**.
* My goal is to design robust, scalable, and secure cloud infrastructure while continuing to build high-performance applications using the **.NET** and **Java** ecosystems.
* I am currently studying for the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** exam to validate my cloud architectural skills.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I’m currently working on:

* Building **[Grit Ledger](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/Grit-Ledger)**, a PHP API that simulates a banking backend. It allows users to transfer "money" between accounts. It focuses on ACID compliance (ensuring money never disappears during a crash) and uses AWS services to host it.

## My Tech Stack:

* **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (Currently Studying), AWS SAM, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), AWS IAM, AWS Security Group, Docker, Docker Compose, Azure DevOps, Azure Pipelines, CI/CD.
* **Languages:** C#, Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, PHP
* **Frameworks:** .NET 8, Blazor, ASP.NET Identity, Entity Framework Core, Spring Boot, Laravel.
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Azure SQL Database, LocalDb
* **Concepts:** System Architecture, Cloud Infrastructure, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Secure API Design, Database Normalization, ACID compliance

## Featured Projects:

* **[ToroTrack | Client Collaboration Tool](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/ToroTrack)**
  * A modern web app built with .NET 8 and Blazor, fully containerized with Docker and automated via **Azure Pipelines** and **Azure App Service**.
  
* **[Mofani](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/Mofani)**
  * A comprehensive donation and volunteer management system featuring complex role-based security and Azure SQL integration automated via **Azure Pipelines** and    **Azure App Service**.
 
* **[S3entinel](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/S3entinel)**
  * A backend API that lets users securely upload files which triggers an asynchronous metadata extraction process, featuring fully automated infrastructure provisioning via AWS SAM.

* **[Grit Ledger](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/Grit-Ledger)**
  * A PHP API that allows users to transfer "money" between accounts while ensuring money never disappears during a crash.

* **[Velosales](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/Velosales.git)**
  * A feature that calculates how fast specific products are selling. It acts as a backend utility for a larger inventory system. It is a Java REST API that accepts sales data batches and returns stock velocity metrics.
