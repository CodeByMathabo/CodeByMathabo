## Hi, I'm Mathabo

* I am a software developer transitioning into **Cloud Architecture** and **DevOps Engineering**.
* My goal is to design robust, scalable, and secure cloud infrastructure while continuing to build high-performance applications using the **.NET** and **Java** ecosystems.
* I am currently studying for the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** exam to validate my cloud architectural skills.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I’m currently working on:

* Building **[S3entinel](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/S3entinel)**, a backend API that lets users securely upload files (images or PDFs), which triggers an asynchronous analysis process to extract metadata and store it in a NoSQL database, featuring fully automated infrastructure provisioning via AWS SAM (Infrastructure as Code).

## My Tech Stack:

* **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (Currently Studying), AWS SAM, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Docker, Docker Compose, Azure DevOps, Azure Pipelines, CI/CD.
* **Languages:** C#, Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS
* **Frameworks:** .NET 8, Blazor, ASP.NET Identity, Entity Framework Core, Spring Boot
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Azure SQL Database, LocalDb
* **Concepts:** System Architecture, Cloud Infrastructure, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Secure API Design, Database Normalization

## Featured Projects:

* **[ToroTrack | Client Collaboration Tool](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/ToroTrack)**
  * A modern web app built with .NET 8 and Blazor, fully containerized with Docker and automated via **Azure Pipelines** and **Azure App Service**.
  
* **[Mofani](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/GiftOfTheGiver_Foundation)**
  * A comprehensive donation and volunteer management system featuring complex role-based security and Azure SQL integration automated via **Azure Pipelines** and    **Azure App Service**.
 
* **[S3entinel](https://github.com/CodeByMathabo/S3entinel)**
  * A backend API that lets users securely upload files which triggers an asynchronous metadata extraction process, featuring fully automated infrastructure provisioning via AWS SAM.
